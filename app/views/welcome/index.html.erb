					<p>Time moves so fast. It's hard to keep track of what's important. That's why Moment is here to help you remember the days as they go by! Create journals to record separate aspects of your life, and add moments to those journals. Spice them up with photos from Facebook or Instagram. Want to share a special moment? You can do that - but don't worry, your moments won't be public unless you want them to be!</p>
